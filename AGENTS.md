# AI Coding Assistant Context

This document provides context for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini
CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to understand the ADK Python project and
assist with development.

## Project Overview

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit for
building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and
control. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is
model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other
frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software
development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate
agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

### Key Components

-   **Agent** - Blueprint defining identity, instructions, and tools
    (`LlmAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, etc.)
-   **Runner** - Execution engine that orchestrates agent execution. It manages
    the 'Reason-Act' loop, processes messages within a session, generates
    events, calls LLMs, executes tools, and handles multi-agent coordination. It
    interacts with various services like session management, artifact storage,
    and memory, and integrates with application-wide plugins. The runner
    provides different execution modes: `run_async` for asynchronous execution
    in production, `run_live` for bidirectional streaming interaction, and
    `run` for synchronous execution suitable for local testing and debugging. At
    the end of each invocation, it can perform event compaction to manage
    session history size.
-   **Tool** - Functions/capabilities agents can call (Python functions, OpenAPI
    specs, MCP tools, Google API tools)
-   **Session** - Conversation state management (in-memory, Vertex AI,
    Spanner-backed)
-   **Memory** - Long-term recall across sessions

### How the Runner Works

The Runner is the stateless orchestration engine that manages agent execution.
It does not hold conversation history in memory; instead, it relies on services
like `SessionService`, `ArtifactService`, and `MemoryService` for persistence.

**Invocation Lifecycle:**

Each call to `runner.run_async()` or `runner.run()` processes a single user
turn, known as an **invocation**.

1.  **Session Retrieval:** When `run_async()` is called with a `session_id`, the
    runner fetches the session state, including all conversation events, from
    the `SessionService`.
2.  **Context Creation:** It creates an `InvocationContext` containing the
    session, the new user message, and references to persistence services.
3.  **Agent Execution:** The runner calls `agent.run_async()` with this context.
    The agent then enters its reason-act loop, which may involve:
    *   Calling an LLM for reasoning.
    *   Executing tools (function calling).
    *   Generating text or audio responses.
    *   Transferring control to sub-agents.
4.  **Event Streaming & Persistence:** Each step in the agent's execution (LLM
    call, tool call, tool response, model response) generates `Event` objects.
    The runner streams these events back to the caller and simultaneously
    appends them to the session via `SessionService`.
5.  **Invocation Completion:** Once the agent has produced its final response
    for the turn (e.g., a text response to the user), the agent's execution loop
    finishes.
6.  **Event Compaction:** If event compaction is configured, the runner may
    summarize older events in the session to manage context window limits,
    appending a `CompactedEvent` to the session.
7.  **Next Turn:** When the user sends another message, a new `run_async()`
    invocation begins, repeating the cycle by loading the session, which now
    includes the events from all prior turns.

### ADK Live (Bidi-streaming)

-   ADK live feature can be accessed from runner.run_live(...) and corresponding
    FAST api endpoint.
-   ADK live feature is built on top of
    [Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api).
    We integrate Gemini Live API through
    [GenAI SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai).
-   ADK live related configs are in
    [run_config.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py).
-   ADK live under multi-agent scenario: we convert the audio into text. This
    text will be passed to next agent as context.
-   Most logics are in
    [base_llm_flow.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/flows/llm_flows/base_llm_flow.py)
    and
    [gemini_llm_connection.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/models/gemini_llm_connection.py).
-   Input transcription and output transcription should be added to session as
    Event.
-   User audio or model audio should be saved into artifacts with a reference in
    Event to it.
-   Tests are in
    [tests/unittests/streaming](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/tests/unittests/streaming).

### Agent Structure Convention (Required)

**All agent directories must follow this structure:** `my_agent/ ├──
__init__.py # MUST contain: from . import agent └── agent.py # MUST define:
root_agent = Agent(...) OR app = App(...)`

**Choose one pattern based on your needs:**

**Option 1 - Simple Agent (for basic agents without plugins):** ```python from
google.adk.agents import Agent from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent( name="search_assistant", model="gemini-2.5-flash",
instruction="You are a helpful assistant.", description="An assistant that can
search the web.", tools=[google_search] ) ```

**Option 2 - App Pattern (when you need plugins, event compaction, custom
configuration):** ```python from google.adk import Agent from google.adk.apps
import App from google.adk.plugins import ContextFilterPlugin

root_agent = Agent( name="my_agent", model="gemini-2.5-flash", instruction="You
are a helpful assistant.", tools=[...], )

app = App( name="my_app", root_agent=root_agent, plugins=[
ContextFilterPlugin(num_invocations_to_keep=3), ], ) ```

**Rationale:** This structure allows the ADK CLI (`adk web`, `adk run`, etc.) to
automatically discover and load agents without additional configuration.

## Development Setup

### Requirements

**Minimum requirements:**

- Python 3.10+ (**Python 3.11+ strongly recommended** for best performance)
- `uv` package manager (**required** - faster than pip/venv)

**Install uv if not already installed:** `bash curl -LsSf
https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### Setup Instructions

**Standard setup for development:** ```bash

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.11

uv venv --python "python3.11" ".venv" source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies for development

uv sync --all-extras ```

**Minimal setup for testing only (matches CI):** `bash uv sync --extra test
--extra eval --extra a2a`

**Virtual Environment Usage (Required):** - **Always use** `.venv/bin/python` or
`.venv/bin/pytest` directly - **Or activate** with `source .venv/bin/activate`
before running commands - **Never use** `python -m venv` - always create with
`uv venv` if missing

**Rationale:** `uv` is significantly faster and ensures consistent dependency
resolution across the team.

### Building

```bash
# Build wheel
uv build

# Install local build for testing
pip install dist/google_adk-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Running Agents Locally

**For interactive development and debugging:** ```bash

# Launch web UI (recommended for development)

adk web path/to/agents_dir ```

**For CLI-based testing:** ```bash

# Interactive CLI (prompts for user input)

adk run path/to/my_agent ```

**For API/production mode:** ```bash

# Start FastAPI server

adk api_server path/to/agents_dir ```

**For running evaluations:** ```bash

# Run evaluation set against agent

adk eval path/to/my_agent path/to/eval_set.json ```

## ADK: Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

The project follows the Google Python Style Guide. Key conventions are enforced
using `pylint` with the provided `pylintrc` configuration file. Here are some of
the key style points:

*   **Indentation**: 2 spaces.
*   **Line Length**: Maximum 80 characters.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   `function_and_variable_names`: `snake_case`
    *   `ClassNames`: `CamelCase`
    *   `CONSTANTS`: `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`
*   **Docstrings**: Required for all public modules, functions, classes, and
    methods.
*   **Imports**: Organized and sorted.
*   **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions should be caught, not general ones
    like `Exception`.

### Autoformat (Required Before Committing)

**Always run** before committing code: `bash ./autoformat.sh`

**Manual formatting** (if needed): ```bash

# Format imports

isort src/ tests/ contributing/

# Format code style

pyink --config pyproject.toml src/ tests/ contributing/ ```

**Check formatting** without making changes: `bash pyink --check --diff --config
pyproject.toml src/ isort --check src/`

**Formatting Standards (Enforced by CI):** - **Formatter:** `pyink`
(Google-style Python formatter) - **Line length:** 80 characters maximum -
**Indentation:** 2 spaces (never tabs) - **Import sorter:** `isort` with Google
profile - **Linter:** `pylint` with Google Python Style Guide

**Rationale:** Consistent formatting eliminates style debates and makes code
reviews focus on logic rather than style.

### In ADK source

Below styles applies to the ADK source code (under `src/` folder of the GitHub
repo).

#### Use relative imports (Required)

```python
# DO - Use relative imports
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - No absolute imports
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Relative imports make the code more maintainable and avoid
circular import issues in large codebases.

#### Import from module, not from `__init__.py` (Required)

```python
# DO - Import directly from module
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - Import from __init__.py
from ..agents import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Direct module imports make dependencies explicit and improve IDE
navigation and refactoring.

#### Always do `from __future__ import annotations` (Required)

**Rule:** Every source file must include `from __future__ import annotations`
immediately after the license header, before any other imports.

```python
# Copyright 2026 Google LLC
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at
#
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
#
# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.

from __future__ import annotations  # REQUIRED - Always include this

# ... rest of imports ...
```

**Rationale:** This enables forward-referencing classes without quotes,
improving code readability and type hint support (PEP 563).

### In ADK tests

#### Use absolute imports (Required)

**Rule:** Test code must use absolute imports (`google.adk.*`) to match how
users import ADK.

```python
# DO - Use absolute imports
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - No relative imports in tests
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Tests should exercise the same import paths that users will use,
catching issues with the public API.

## ADK: Local Testing

### Unit Tests

**Quick start:** Run all tests with: `bash pytest tests/unittests`

**Recommended:** Match CI configuration before submitting PRs: `bash uv sync
--extra test --extra eval --extra a2a && pytest tests/unittests`

**Additional options:** ```bash

# Run tests in parallel for faster execution

pytest tests/unittests -n auto

# Run a specific test file during development

pytest tests/unittests/agents/test_llm_agent.py

```

### Testing Philosophy

**Use real code over mocks:** ADK tests should use real implementations as much
as possible instead of mocking. Only mock external dependencies like network
calls or cloud services.

**Test interface behavior, not implementation details:** Tests should verify
that the public API behaves correctly, not how it's implemented internally. This
makes tests resilient to refactoring and ensures the contract with users remains
intact.

**Test Requirements:** - Fast and isolated tests where possible - Use real ADK
components; mock only external dependencies (LLM APIs, cloud services, etc.) -
Focus on testing public interfaces and behavior, not internal implementation -
Descriptive test names that explain what behavior is being tested - High
coverage for new features, edge cases, and error conditions - Location:
`tests/unittests/` following source structure

## Docstring and comments

### Comments - Explaining the Why, Not the What

Philosophy: Well-written code should be largely self-documenting. Comments serve
a different purpose: they should explain the complex algorithms, non-obvious
business logic, or the rationale behind a particular implementation choice—the
things the code cannot express on its own. Avoid comments that merely restate
what the code does (e.g., # increment i above i += 1).

Style: Comments should be written as complete sentences. Block comments must
begin with a # followed by a single space.

## Versioning

ADK adherence to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Core Principle: The adk-python project strictly adheres to the Semantic
Versioning 2.0.0 specification. All release versions will follow the
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Breaking Change

A breaking change is any modification that introduces backward-incompatible
changes to the public API. In the context of the ADK, this means a change that
could force a developer using the framework to alter their existing code to
upgrade to the new version. The public API is not limited to just the Python
function and class signatures; it also encompasses data schemas for stored
information (like evaluation datasets), the command-line interface (CLI), and
the data format used for server communications.

### Public API Surface Definition

The "public API" of ADK is a broad contract that extends beyond its Python
function signatures. A breaking change in any of the following areas can disrupt
user workflows and the wider ecosystem of agents and tools built with ADK. The
analysis of the breaking changes introduced in v1.0.0 demonstrates the expansive
nature of this contract. For the purposes of versioning, the ADK Public API
Surface is defined as:

-   All public classes, methods, and functions in the google.adk namespace.

-   The names, required parameters, and expected behavior of all built-in Tools
    (e.g., google_search, BuiltInCodeExecutor).

-   The structure and schema of persisted data, including Session data, Memory,
    and Evaluation datasets.

-   The JSON request/response format of the ADK API server(FastAPI server) used
    by adk web, including field casing conventions.

-   The command-line interface (CLI) commands, arguments, and flags (e.g., adk
    deploy).

-   The expected file structure for agent definitions that are loaded by the
    framework (e.g., the agent.py convention).

#### Checklist for Breaking Changes:

The following changes are considered breaking and necessitate a MAJOR version
bump.

-   API Signature Change: Renaming, removing, or altering the required
    parameters of any public class, method, or function (e.g., the removal of
    the list_events method from BaseSessionService).

-   Architectural Shift: A fundamental change to a core component's behavior
    (e.g., making all service methods async, which requires consumers to use
    await).

-   Data Schema Change: A non-additive change to a persisted data schema that
    renders old data unreadable or invalid (e.g., the redesign of the
    MemoryService and evaluation dataset schemas).

-   Tool Interface Change: Renaming a built-in tool, changing its required
    parameters, or altering its fundamental purpose (e.g., replacing
    BuiltInCodeExecutionTool with BuiltInCodeExecutor and moving it from the
    tools parameter to the code_executor parameter of an Agent).

-   Configuration Change: Altering the required structure of configuration files
    or agent definition files that the framework loads (e.g., the simplification
    of the agent.py structure for MCPToolset).

-   Wire Format Change: Modifying the data format for API server interactions
    (e.g., the switch from snake_case to camelCase for all JSON payloads).

-   Dependency Removal: Removing support for a previously integrated third-party
    library or tool type.

## Commit Message Format (Required)

**All commits must** follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

**Format:** ``` <type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer] ```

**Common types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:** ``` feat(agents): Add support for App pattern with plugins

fix(sessions): Prevent memory leak in session cleanup

refactor(tools): Unify environment variable enabled checks ```

**Rationale:** Conventional commits enable automated changelog generation and
version management.

## Python Tips

### General Python Best Practices

*   **Constants:** Use immutable global constant collections (tuple, frozenset, immutabledict) to avoid hard-to-find bugs. Prefer constants over wild string/int literals, especially for dictionary keys, pathnames, and enums.
*   **Naming:** Name mappings like `value_by_key` to enhance readability in lookups (e.g., `item = item_by_id[id]`).
*   **Readability:** Use f-strings for concise string formatting, but use lazy-evaluated `%`-based templates for logging. Use `repr()` or `pprint.pformat()` for human-readable debug messages. Use `_` as a separator in numeric literals to improve readability.
*   **Comprehensions:** Use list, set, and dict comprehensions for building collections concisely.
*   **Iteration:** Iterate directly over containers without indices. Use `enumerate()` when you need the index, `dict.items()` for keys and values, and `zip()` for parallel iteration.
*   **Built-ins:** Leverage built-in functions like `all()`, `any()`, `reversed()`, `sum()`, etc., to write more concise and efficient code.
*   **Flattening Lists:** Use `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` to flatten a list of lists efficiently without unnecessary copying.
*   **String Methods:** Use `startswith()` and `endswith()` with a tuple of strings to check for multiple prefixes or suffixes at once.
*   **Decorators:** Use decorators to add common functionality (like logging, timing, caching) to functions without modifying their core logic. Use `functools.wraps()` to preserve the original function's metadata.
*   **Context Managers:** Use `with` statements and context managers (from `contextlib` or custom classes with `__enter__`/`__exit__`) to ensure resources are properly initialized and torn down, even in the presence of exceptions.
*   **Else Clauses:** Utilize the `else` clause in `try/except` blocks (runs if no exception), and in `for/while` loops (runs if the loop completes without a `break`) to write more expressive and less error-prone code.
*   **Single Assignment:** Prefer single-assignment form (assign to a variable once) over assign-and-mutate to reduce bugs and improve readability. Use conditional expressions where appropriate.
*   **Equality vs. Identity:** Use `is` or `is not` for singleton comparisons (e.g., `None`, `True`, `False`). Use `==` for value comparison.
*   **Object Comparisons:** When implementing custom classes, be careful with `__eq__`. Return `NotImplemented` for unhandled types. Consider edge cases like subclasses and hashing. Prefer using `attrs` or `dataclasses` to handle this automatically.
*   **Hashing:** If objects are equal, their hashes must be equal. Ensure attributes used in `__hash__` are immutable. Disable hashing with `__hash__ = None` if custom `__eq__` is implemented without a proper `__hash__`.
*   **`__init__()` vs. `__new__()`:** `__new__()` creates the object, `__init__()` initializes it. For immutable types, modifications must happen in `__new__()`.
*   **Default Arguments:** NEVER use mutable default arguments. Use `None` as a sentinel value instead.
*   **`__add__()` vs. `__iadd__()`:** `x += y` (in-place add) can modify the object in-place if `__iadd__` is implemented (like for lists), while `x = x + y` creates a new object. This matters when multiple variables reference the same object.
*   **Properties:** Use `@property` to create getters and setters only when needed, maintaining a simple attribute access syntax. Avoid properties for computationally expensive operations or those that can fail.
*   **Modules for Namespacing:** Use modules as the primary mechanism for grouping and namespacing code elements, not classes. Avoid `@staticmethod` and methods that don't use `self`.
*   **Argument Passing:** Python is call-by-value, where the values are object references (pointers). Assignment binds a name to an object. Modifying a mutable object through one name affects all names bound to it.
*   **Keyword/Positional Arguments:** Use `*` to force keyword-only arguments and `/` to force positional-only arguments. This can prevent argument transposition errors and make APIs clearer, especially for functions with multiple arguments of the same type.
*   **Type Hinting:** Annotate code with types to improve readability, debuggability, and maintainability. Use abstract types from `collections.abc` for container annotations (e.g., `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable`). Annotate return values, including `None`. Choose the most appropriate abstract type for function arguments and return types.
*   **`NewType`:** Use `typing.NewType` to create distinct types from primitives (like `int` or `str`) to prevent argument transposition and improve type safety.
*   **`__repr__()` vs. `__str__()`:** Implement `__repr__()` for unambiguous, developer-focused string representations, ideally evaluable. Implement `__str__()` for human-readable output. `__str__()` defaults to `__repr__()`.
*   **F-string Debug:** Use `f"{expr=}"` for concise debug printing, showing both the expression and its value.

### Libraries and Tools

*   **`collections.Counter`:** Use for efficiently counting hashable objects in an iterable.
*   **`collections.defaultdict`:** Useful for avoiding key checks when initializing dictionary values, e.g., appending to lists.
*   **`heapq`:** Use `heapq.nlargest()` and `heapq.nsmallest()` for efficiently finding the top/bottom N items. Use `heapq.merge()` to merge multiple sorted iterables.
*   **`attrs` / `dataclasses`:** Use these libraries to easily define simple classes with boilerplate methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc., automatically generated.
*   **NumPy:** Use NumPy for efficient array computing, element-wise operations, math functions, filtering, and aggregations on numerical data.
*   **Pandas:** When constructing DataFrames row by row, append to a list of dicts and call `pd.DataFrame()` once to avoid inefficient copying. Use `TypedDict` or `dataclasses` for intermediate row data.
*   **Flags:** Use libraries like `argparse` or `click` for command-line flag parsing. Access flag values in a type-safe manner.
*   **Serialization:** For cross-language serialization, consider JSON (built-in), Protocol Buffers, or msgpack. For Python serialization with validation, use `pydantic` for runtime validation and automatic (de)serialization, or `cattrs` for performance-focused (de)serialization with `dataclasses` or `attrs`.
*   **Regular Expressions:** Use `re.VERBOSE` to make complex regexes more readable with whitespace and comments. Choose the right method (`re.search`, `re.fullmatch`). Avoid regexes for simple string checks (`in`, `startswith`, `endswith`). Compile regexes used multiple times with `re.compile()`.
*   **Caching:** Use `functools.lru_cache` with care. Prefer immutable return types. Be cautious when memoizing methods, as it can lead to memory leaks if the instance is part of the cache key; consider `functools.cached_property`.
*   **Pickle:** Avoid using `pickle` due to security risks and compatibility issues. Prefer JSON, Protocol Buffers, or msgpack for serialization.
*   **Multiprocessing:** Be aware of potential issues with `multiprocessing` on some platforms, especially concerning `fork`. Consider alternatives like threads (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) or `asyncio` for I/O-bound tasks.
*   **Debugging:** Use `IPython.embed()` or `pdb.set_trace()` to drop into an interactive shell for debugging. Use visual debuggers if available. Log with context, including inputs and exception info using `logging.exception()` or `exc_info=True`.
*   **Property-Based Testing & Fuzzing:** Use `hypothesis` for property-based testing that generates test cases automatically. For coverage-guided fuzzing, consider `atheris` or `python-afl`.

### Testing

*   **Assertions:** Use pytest's native `assert` statements with informative expressions. Pytest automatically provides detailed failure messages showing the values involved. Add custom messages with `assert condition, "helpful message"` when the expression alone isn't clear.
*   **Custom Assertions:** Write reusable helper functions (not methods) for repeated complex checks. Use `pytest.fail("message")` to explicitly fail a test with a custom message.
*   **Parameterized Tests:** Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to reduce duplication when running the same test logic with different inputs. This is more idiomatic than the `parameterized` library.
*   **Fixtures:** Use pytest fixtures (with `@pytest.fixture`) for test setup, teardown, and dependency injection. Fixtures are cleaner than class-based setup methods and can be easily shared across tests.
*   **Mocking:** Use `mock.create_autospec()` with `spec_set=True` to create mocks that match the original object's interface, preventing typos and API mismatch issues. Use context managers (`with mock.patch(...)`) to manage mock lifecycles and ensure patches are stopped. Prefer injecting dependencies via fixtures over patching.
*   **Asserting Mock Calls:** Use `mock.ANY` and other matchers for partial argument matching when asserting mock calls (e.g., `assert_called_once_with`).
*   **Temporary Files:** Use pytest's `tmp_path` and `tmp_path_factory` fixtures for creating isolated and automatically cleaned-up temporary files/directories. These are preferred over the `tempfile` module in pytest tests.
*   **Avoid Randomness:** Do not use random number generators to create inputs for unit tests. This leads to flaky, hard-to-debug tests. Instead, use deterministic, easy-to-reason-about inputs that cover specific behaviors.
*   **Test Invariants:** Focus tests on the invariant behaviors of public APIs, not implementation details.
*   **Test Organization:** Prefer simple test functions over class-based tests unless you need to share fixtures across multiple test methods in a class. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested.

### Error Handling

*   **Re-raising Exceptions:** Use a bare `raise` to re-raise the current exception, preserving the original stack trace. Use `raise NewException from original_exception` to chain exceptions, providing context. Use `raise NewException from None` to suppress the original exception's context.
*   **Exception Messages:** Always include a descriptive message when raising exceptions.
*   **Converting Exceptions to Strings:** `str(e)` can be uninformative. `repr(e)` is often better. For full details including tracebacks and chained exceptions, use functions from the `traceback` module (e.g., `traceback.format_exception(e)`, `traceback.format_exc()`).
*   **Terminating Programs:** Use `sys.exit()` for expected terminations. Uncaught non-`SystemExit` exceptions should signal bugs. Avoid functions that cause immediate, unclean exits like `os.abort()`.
*   **Returning None:** Be consistent. If a function can return a value, all paths should return a value (use `return None` explicitly). Bare `return` is only for early exit in conceptually void functions (annotated with `-> None`).
